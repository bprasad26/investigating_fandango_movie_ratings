In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data
and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased
and dishonest ([Fandango](https://www.fandango.com/) is an online movie ratings aggregator). He published his
analysis [in this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) — a great piece of data journalism that's totally worth
reading.

Fandango displays a 5-star rating system on their website, where the minimum
rating is 0 stars and the maximum is 5 stars.

Hickey found that there's a significant discrepancy between the number of stars
displayed to users and the actual rating, which he was able to find in the HTML
of the page. He was able to find that:

* The actual rating was almost always rounded up to the nearest half-star.
For instance, a 4.1 movie would be rounded off to 4.5 stars, not to 4 stars,
as you may expect.

* In the case of 8% of the ratings analyzed, the rounding up was done to the
nearest whole star. For instance, a 4.5 rating would be rounded off to 5 stars.

* For one movie rating, the rounding off was completely bizarre: from a rating
of 4 in the HTML of the page to a displayed rating of 5 stars.

In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine
whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's
analysis or not.
